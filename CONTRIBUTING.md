## Contribute code changes
Raise a pull request on our [Github project](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi2d) and follow the template.

### Notes
* We do not accept contributions from people who work for/at Live2D inc. and affiliates.
* We will not accept pull requests that aim to support other 2d puppet formats within Inochi2D.
* Please do not submit code that is stolen from propriatary software.

### On Generative AI
While we can't prevent people from submitting code written using generative AI, we strongly advise against it. If you do insist on using generative AI please ensure you understand the code you submit
fully. Any code submitted that you do not yourself understand and can't easily fix will be rejected.

Repeat attempts to submit broken, untested code with signs of being "vibe coded" may result in your
permissions to submit code to the Inochi2D repositories to be revoked.

## Contribute documentation
To change the code-level documentation, raise a pull request on our [Github project](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi2d) and follow the template.

### On Generative AI
Documentation is important, and so is the correctness of said documentation; no documentation is better than misleading or wrong documentation. Using AI tools to generate documentation often hits snags like this, and as such, if you insist on using AI tools to assist in documentation writing, please confirm
its accuracy before submission. As with code, repeat attempts to submit documentation which is misleading may result in your pull-request priviledges being revoked.

## Contribute test material
We'll be happy if any artists for vtuber models donate any old model textures for testing, doing so can be done via [DMing Luna on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Clipsey5).  
Note you still retain all rights to your art/models and they will only be used for internal testing, if you at one point want to revoke your art as test material just tell Luna and she'll delete the textures.

## Join the community
We recommend you familiarize yourself with our [code of conduct](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi2d/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Once you have done so, you are welcome to join us on [Luna's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/tNfMGgJ9Fn). That communication channel is where our internal discussions happen and project decisions are made.
